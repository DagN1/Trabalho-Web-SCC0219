### 1. Requirements
* The system must have 2 types of users: Clients and Administrators
  * Administrators are responsible for registering/managing administrators, customers, and products/services provided. The application already comes with an account admin with password admin.
  * Customers are users who access the system to buy products/services.
* The admin record includes, at least: name, id, phone, email.
* Each customer's record includes, at least: name, id, address, phone, email
* Product/services records include, at least: name, id, photo, description, price, quantity (in stock), quantity sold.
* Your store may sell products, services or both (you decide)
* Selling Products (or services): Products are selected, their quantity chosen, and are included in a cart. Products are purchased using a credit card number (any number is accepted by the system). The quantity of product sold is subtracted from the quantity in stock and added to the quantity sold. Carts are emptied only on payment or by customers.
* Product/Service Management: Administrators can create/update/read/delete (crud) new products and services. For example, they can change the stock quantity.
* Your functionality: Create a functionality that is specific to your application. It does not have to be something complicated. For instance, if you are selling cars, you may allow users to use an accelerator to hear how each car engine roars up and down.   
* The system must provide accessibility requirements and provide good usability. The system must be responsive, meaning that it should complete assigned tasks within a reasonable time.




### 2. Project Description
* The base design of the website was made in figma using material design icons and unsplash images (figma plugins), the HTML and CSS for Milestone 1 was made by hand.
* The purpose of the website is to be a clothes store, the user will start at the main menu when entering the website (e.g: www.theclothesstore.com) and will be redirect via the top bar, by clicking on itens or by adding to cart, the top bar will work in all pages of the website and will redirect through the icon(top left) to the main page, the search bar will result in a search on the list of itens on the shopping page, and finally the two top icons will redirect to the shopping cart or the user account. 
* As a method of navigating the website we will be implementing a "Bread Crumb", in another words a "path" to the exact search/item category we have on that page for the user to click in any of the steps, aswell as a simple categories list dividing clothes by type and sex.
* Both admin and user will login through the same page.
* The project design can be viewed in figma on this link: https://www.figma.com/file/MnyLYe5yCZLxmz1epT5qTI/Trabalho-Web-SCC0219?node-id=0%3A1 
or as a slide show https://www.figma.com/proto/MnyLYe5yCZLxmz1epT5qTI/Trabalho-Web-SCC0219?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1
* Drawio diagram of the website:
  * Note, the top bar will me visible in every page, and the "Bread Crumb" can be see in between Shopping Page and Item Page.
